# Mini Project

University Managment-System created by Dhouibi Mohamed Aziz

# University Management System

The University Management System is a comprehensive Java console application designed to manage various aspects of a university. This project showcases the implementation of various classes and their interactions within a university setting using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Features

### Person Management

The system includes a [`Person`](Person.java) class which is extended by [`Student`](Student.java) and [`Teacher`](Teacher.java) classes. These classes allow for the management of students and teachers, including enrolling students in courses and assigning teachers to courses.

### Course Management

The [`Course`](Course.java) class allows for the creation and management of courses. It includes methods for adding students and teachers to courses, and for changing the number of credit hours of a course.

### Classroom Management

The [`Classroom`](Classroom.java) class allows for the management of classrooms. It includes methods for adding courses to classrooms.

### Club and Group Management

The [`Club`](Club.java) and [`Group`](Group.java) classes allow for the management of clubs and groups. They include methods for adding members to clubs and groups.

### Event Management

The [`Event`](Event.java) class allows for the creation and management of events. It includes methods for adding attendees to events and for changing the date of an event.

### Timetable Management

The [`Timetable`](Timetable.java) class allows for the management of student timetables. It includes methods for adding courses to timetables.

### Admin Staff Management

The [`AdminStaff`](AdminStaff.java) class represents administrative staff in the university. It includes methods for managing administrative tasks.

### Exam Management

The [`Exam`](Exam.java) class represents exams in the university. It includes methods for managing exam details.

## Usage

The main entry point of the application is the [`Main`](Main.java) class. This class creates instances of the various classes and tests their functionalities.

## Overall

This project provides a comprehensive example of how OOP principles can be used to model and manage complex systems such as a university. It demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in Java.
